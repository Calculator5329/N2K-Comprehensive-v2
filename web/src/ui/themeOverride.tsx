/**
 * React-context override for the active theme inside a subtree.
 *
 * The global theme lives on the `ThemeStore` (`<html data-theme="…">`)
 * and components like `DiceGlyph` / `Equation` normally read it from
 * `useStore()`. Phase 6's edition gallery needs to render every theme
 * simultaneously without mutating the global store, so each card wraps
 * its preview in a `<ThemeScope theme="…">` that:
 *
 *   1. Sets `data-theme` on a wrapper `<div>` so the CSS variable
 *      blocks in `globals.css` pick up the per-card palette/fonts.
 *   2. Pushes a context value so glyph + equation components render
 *      their per-theme variant (e.g. ASCII for Phosphor) instead of
 *      always rendering the globally selected variant.
 *
 * Any consumer that needs the active theme should call
 * `useActiveThemeId()` instead of `useStore().theme.theme`. Outside of
 * a `<ThemeScope>` it falls through to the store, so non-gallery code
 * paths are unaffected.
